I plan to focus on China as my empirical case and crape censored and uncensored posts on Chinese social media related to a selection of events related to public goods provision and the leaders' backsliding behaviors. My data source is freeweibo(www.freeweibo.com), which has been public subsamples of censored and uncensored posts from Sina Weibo(www.weibo.com). Essentially, I will compare the ratio of the posts that are censored under each category, and contextual differences(for instance, whether the posts expresses support or objecion for governemnt polices).\n"

        "I chose to use data from Sina Weibo and freeweibo becuase: First, they are good data sources that allow us to directly observe the censorship outcome of the Chinese government. Second, they are easily accesible (getting access to cenosored posts is not always easy). With that being said, there are a few limitations. First, freeweibo only makes public a *subsample* of all censored posts, which would like add noise to the analysis because of the limited size of the censored posts. Second, it is possible that censorship we observe from Sina Weibo is not a result of the Censorship decisions of the Chinese government, but rather the social meida platform itself (for eg, Sina Weibo may fear that circulation of sensitive content would lead to some sort of punishment from the Chinese governemnt). To solve for these issues, it will be helpful if I could set up an API to monitor the activities on various social media platforms in China, in which I could obtain a more balanced and larger sample across different social media platforms."
